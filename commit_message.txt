Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(semi-supervised): Add cluster-based label propagation

Implemented third semi-supervised experiment:
- Use cluster assignments as automatic labels for all data points
- Train LogisticRegression on all data with cluster-based labels
- Evaluate effectiveness of unsupervised labeling approach

Explored using clustering as a complete alternative to manual labeling.
Verified: Cluster-based labeling provides reasonable classification accuracy.
