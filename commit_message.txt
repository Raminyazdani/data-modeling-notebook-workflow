Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(deps): Add scikit-learn for machine learning

Added machine learning library to requirements.txt:
- scikit-learn>=1.0.0 for K-means, PCA, and LogisticRegression algorithms

After basic data science stack, added the ML library specifically needed for unsupervised learning techniques.
Verified: Complete dependency stack ready for implementation.
