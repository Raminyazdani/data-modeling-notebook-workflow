Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(notebook): Add notebook outline structure

Created notebook organization structure:
- Part One: Clustering Analysis section header
- Part Two: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA section header
- Placeholder cells for each major analysis component

Outlined the major sections before implementing analysis to plan the notebook flow.
Verified: Notebook structure provides clear navigation.
