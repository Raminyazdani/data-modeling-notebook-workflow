Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(pca): Fix PCA components to use even spacing

HOTFIX: Corrected component selection:
- Changed to evenly spaced values: [5, 15, 30, 45, 64]
- Provides better coverage of the component space
- Captures optimal component selection more accurately

After seeing large accuracy jump between 16 and 32, realized we needed better granularity in the middle range.
This represents catching an analysis gap through result inspection.
Verified: PCA results show smoother accuracy progression.
