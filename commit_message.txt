Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(clustering): Fix k value to match elbow method recommendation

HOTFIX: Corrected clustering k value:
- Changed k from 10 to 50 in clustering code
- Added comment explaining k=50 selection based on elbow method
- Verified consistency between analysis and implementation

Discovered the k value mismatch when preparing semi-supervised experiments. Fixed by aligning implementation with analysis.
Verified: k=50 used consistently throughout clustering code.
