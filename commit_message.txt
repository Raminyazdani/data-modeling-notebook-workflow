Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | WIP(semi-supervised): Add baseline training code structure

Implemented baseline semi-supervised experiment framework:
- Created code structure for training LogisticRegression on 50 labeled samples
- Set up train/test split with random_state=42
- Prepared model initialization

Establishing baseline code structure before running experiments.
Verified: Code structure in place, ready for execution.
