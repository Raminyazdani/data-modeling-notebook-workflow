Implemented elbow method analysis:
- Calculate inertia for k=1 to 100
- Create elbow curve visualization showing optimal k≈50
- Added analysis questions section

ERROR INTRODUCED: Set k=10 in subsequent clustering code despite elbow suggesting k≈50.
This represents a common mistake where analysis results aren't immediately applied to implementation.
Verified: Elbow curve generates correctly (but k value mismatch exists).
