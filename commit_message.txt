Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(semi-supervised): Complete baseline experiment with results

Completed first semi-supervised experiment:
- Train LogisticRegression on only 50 labeled samples
- Evaluate on test set
- Record baseline accuracy for comparison (~0.95 accuracy)

Established a baseline by training with limited labeled data to quantify the benefit of clustering-based approaches.
Verified: Baseline model trains and evaluates successfully.
