Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(notebook): Add import statements and dependencies

Extended notebook with imports cell:
- numpy for numerical operations
- matplotlib.pyplot for visualizations
- sklearn modules for machine learning (datasets, cluster, decomposition, linear_model, model_selection, metrics)

Added all required imports in one cell for clear dependency declaration.
Verified: All imports resolve successfully.
