Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(pca): Implement PCA dimensionality reduction

Added Part Two to the notebook:
- Created PCA analysis function (pca_logistic_regression)
- Implemented dimensionality sweep framework
- Added explained variance analysis structure
- Set up for testing different n_components values

Extended the notebook to cover dimensionality reduction as a complementary unsupervised learning technique.
Verified: PCA function implemented and callable.
