Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(init): Initial repository setup with core files

Created foundational repository structure:
- .gitignore for Python projects (Jupyter checkpoints, pycache, OS files)
- Empty requirements.txt placeholder
- Basic README.md with project title
- Minimal project_identity.md

This establishes the project foundation before adding dependencies and code.
Verified: Files created successfully, repository structure initialized.
