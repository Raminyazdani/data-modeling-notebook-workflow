Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(semi-supervised): Add cluster representative training

Implemented second semi-supervised experiment:
- Extract one representative point from each of k=50 clusters
- Train LogisticRegression on these 50 cluster representatives
- Compare performance to baseline
- Show that strategic sampling can improve results

Tested whether cluster representatives could provide better coverage than random sampling.
Verified: Cluster-based training shows improved accuracy.
