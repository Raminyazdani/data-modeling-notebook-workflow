Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | WIP(pca): Add PCA sweep using powers of 2

Extended PCA analysis with component sweep:
- ERROR: Used powers of 2 for n_components=[4, 8, 16, 32, 64]
- This approach misses important middle values in the component space

Developer mistakenly thought powers of 2 would be a good systematic approach, but this caused gaps in the analysis.
Common error when not thinking about the actual distribution of optimal values.
Verified: PCA runs but component selection is suboptimal.
