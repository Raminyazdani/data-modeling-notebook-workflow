Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(deps): Add Jupyter notebook dependency

Extended requirements.txt with:
- jupyter>=1.0.0 for interactive notebook environment

Separated Jupyter from core computing packages as it's the execution environment rather than a computation library.
Verified: All dependencies in requirements.txt are compatible.
