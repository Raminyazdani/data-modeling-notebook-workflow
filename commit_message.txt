Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | feat(meta): Add portfolio tracking ledgers

Created portfolio meta-documentation:
- suggestion.txt ledger documenting 21 transformations (all STATUS=APPLIED)
- suggestions_done.txt with before/after snippets for all changes
- Proper TAB-separated format for both ledgers

Added tracking documentation to show the transformation from academic assignment to portfolio project.
Verified: Both ledgers properly formatted and complete.
