Ramin Yazdani | unsupervised-learning-clustering-pca | main | WIP(docs): Update README with incorrect Jupyter command

Updated run instructions:
- ERROR: Wrote `jupyter run` instead of `jupyter notebook` in run instructions
- This command doesn't work as intended for interactive notebooks

While updating documentation, developer accidentally used the wrong Jupyter command, mixing up batch execution with interactive mode.
Common documentation error when working with similar command names.
Verified: README updated but contains command error.
